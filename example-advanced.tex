%%%
% This advanced example of a B+ tree is supposed to help creating/modifying B+
% trees using the btreevis package. It covers all possibilities of extending and
% shrinking a B+ tree. Hence, it is a good way to learn and understand what are
% the necessary steps to create and modify B+ trees, i.e. which macros/styles
% have to be used/modified.
%
% All sections and subsections provide a header describing what has to be done 
% and why. Each (sub-)section contains exactly a single tikzpicture containing
% inline comments to describe single parts of the header description.
%
% The (sub-)sections are described in terms of the (sub-)section before. So, if
% a change is described, it is a change with respect to the (sub-)section before.

  % This section describes all possibilities of extending a B+ tree:
  %   - Add values to an existing node when a node is not yet full.
  %   - Add values to an existing node when a node is already full.
  %   - Add a new level to the B+ tree and connect the new nodes/leaves.
  %   - Add a new node to an existing level and connect the new node.

  \section{Extending the B$^+$ tree}

  %%%
  % Values 3 and 9 are added to the existing (empty) node.
  % Hence, the node is neither full before nor after the inserts.
  % 
  % This is probably the easiest thing to do: we simply add the values 3 and 9
  % to the comma-separated list of values (which is empty by now) as third
  % argument of the \CreateBTreeNode macro. The third values is treated as empty
  % and thus the cell will also have no content in it.
  %%% 
  \subsection{Insert 3 and 9}

  % Value 10 is added to the existing node containing two values by now.

  %
  % As the workflow is the same, this should be as easy to understand as the

  % Values 1 and 2 are added to the existing node which is already full. Because
  % the node is already full we need to split the node into two and add another
  % level to the tree.
  %
  % Several things have to be done:
  %   - Add two new calls of the \CreateBTreeNode macro to generate a total of 
  %     three node contents: one root node and its two child nodes.
  %   - When generating the tree, we need two new 'child' clauses to utilize the
  %     tree environment of TikZ to position the nodes properly. We use the newly
  %     generated contents as node contents.
  %   - As we have two tree levels, the \ConnectBTreeNodes and the
  %     \ConnectBTreeLeaves macros have to be used to connect the nodes in a
  %     proper way. Hence, we introduce one call for each of these two macros.
  %   - Because of the two tree levels it is also recommended to add a style for
  %     the new level of the tree.

    % separated list is {1, 2, 3}, and the second node contains two values, i.e.
    % {9, 10}.
    % We also have to provide the correct level number (1) as first argument of
    % both calls as well as the correct node number for each call as second
    % argument, i.e. 1 and 2 respectively.
    % As last argument we need to specify two new variables in which the

    % We connect all leaf nodes of level 1 (first argument) and there are 2 leaf
    % nodes to connect. Remember: the \ConnectBTreeLeaves macro always starts
    % connecting from node number 1 of the supplied level, so no node to start

  %
  % To accomplish this, the following steps have to be done:
  %   - The root node has to be modified. Because we add another node on the
  %     subsequent level, the root node needs to hold another value, i.e. 3.
  %   - Obviously, one new call to the \CreateBTreeNode is necessary to generate
  %     the content of the new leaf node. Thus, also a new variable to hold this
  %     content has to be declared. Furthermore, the node is located between the
  %     two existing leaf nodes. Because of the consecutive numbering of the
  %     nodes, we also have to provide the correct node numbers for the new and
  %     the last leaf node!
  %   - A new child has to be added to the tree containing the newly generated
  %     node content.
  %   - The \ConnectBTreeNodes and \ConnectBTreeLeaves calls have to be adjusted
  %     according to the new number of leaf nodes.

  % Value 8 is added to the third leaf node. This node is overfilled and is split
  % into two nodes. Afterwards, the leaf level of the tree contains of five nodes
  % but the root node only has four pointers. Thus, an additional level has to be
  % added to the tree. The tree afterwards consists of
  %   - one root node holding one value, i.e. {5}.
  %   - two nodes on level 1 holding values {3} and {7, 9}, respectively.
  %   - five leaf nodes on level 2 holding their respective values.
  %
  % This is one of the hardest modifications of an existing B+ tree. The
  % following steps are necessary:
  %   - The root node has to be modified. Because we add another level, the root
  %     node now holds the smallest value of its right subtree, i.e. 5.
  %   - The level of the existing leaf nodes has to be changed to 2 and also
  %     the variable names should be changed accordingly. Although the renaming
  %     is not obligatory as long as the contents are used correctly afterwards,
  %     it is still recommended to keep it traceable and avoid errors.
  %   - Two new (inner) nodes have to be generated on level 1. Remember: these
  %     have to be numbered consecutively, i.e. {1}{1} and {1}{2} as the first
  %     two arguments, respectively.
  %   - One new leaf nodes has to be generated on level 2, holding the values 7
  %     and 8. This node is generated between the nodes previously numbered 3 and
  %     4. Hence, node number 3 keeps its number, the newly generated node gets
  %     number 4 and the previously content numbered 4 is now node number 5.
  %   - The new level has to be added to the tree environment as well.
  %   - The existing \ConnectBTreeNodes call has to be modified because the root
  %     node now only has two child nodes. Furthermore, two new calls of
  %     \CreateBTreeNodes are necessary to draw the connections between two nodes
  %     of level 1 and the 5 leaf nodes of level 2.
  %   - The \ConnectBTreeLeaves call has to be modified according to the new
  %     level of the leaf nodes and the increased number of leaves.
  %   - The tikzpicture options are changed as well:
  %       - The sibling distance of level 1 is increased to 18em. This is
  %         recommended because of the new level. The sibling distance has to
  %         be increased almost every time when adding a new level.
  %       - The level distance of level 1 is decreased to 6em. This is just a
  %         minor adjustment.
  %       - A new style for level 2 is introduced.
  %       - The whole tikzpicture is scaled down to 0.7 now because the tree got
  %         higher and wider.
  %       - A new style is introduced to scale the nodes too. This is necessary
  %         because nodes have to be scaled in TikZ separately. So, we just use
  %         the BTreeNodeDefault style and add a scale clause for the nodes
  %         afterwards.
  %     This is not obligatory but playing around with the sibling and level

  % This section describes all possibilities of shrinking a B+ tree:

  \section{Shrinking the B$^+$ tree}

  %%%
  % Value 7 is removed from the B+ tree, specifically from leaf number 4. After
  % removing 7 from leaf number 4, this leaf has an insufficient number of keys.
  % Hence, it is merged with its left sibling, leaf number 3, which contains the
  % keys 5, 6 and 8 after the merge. Also the parent node has to be updated,
  % because the parent node has two child nodes now (instead of three). Thus, one
  % key has to be removed, i.e. 7.
  %
  % These are the necessary steps:
  %   - One of the existing \CreateBTreeNode calls has to be removed, preferably
  %     the one of node number 5 because we only have four leaf nodes afterwards.
  %   - The values of node number 3 need to be changed. In essence, value 8 has
  %     to be added to the comma-separated list supplied as third argument.
  %   - Because we removed one \CreateBTreeNode call, we have to remove one child
  %     from the tree as well.
  %   - The last call of the \ConnectBTreeNodes macro has to be updated. Now
  %     there are only two instead of three child nodes.
  %   - The \ConnectBTreeLeaves call has to be modified. Only four leaves need to
  %     be connected (instead of formerly five).
  %   - The tikzpicture options are not altered (not obligatory). However, the
  %     sibling/level distances could be adjusted here if desired (e.g. to reduce
  %     the horizontal distance between the leaves).

  % Hence, we can keep the two existing nodes and just alter their values
  % accordingly. Node number 3 holds the two smaller values, i.e. 5 and 6, and

  % hold the smallest value of the subtree the pointer points to. In this case
  % this is 8.
  %
  % The following steps need to be done:
  %   - Remove value 10 from the content of the last leaf node

  % Value 6 is removed from the B+ tree, specifically from leaf number 3. Thus,
  % this leaf consists of an insufficient number of keys and is merged with its
  % right sibling (because no left sibling exists). After this merge, the parent
  % of the resulting node would just have a single child node, which is not
  % B+ tree compliant. Hence, we need to remove the whole mid level (level 1) of
  % the tree because three leaf nodes are covered by a single root node with two
  % keys and three pointers. So, the resulting B+ tree consists of:
  %   - A root node holding the values 3 and 5 (smallest value of the respective
  %     right subtree).
  %   - Three leaf nodes holding the values {1, 2}, {3, 4} and {5, 8, 9},
  %     respectively.
  %
  % This is one of the hardest modifications of an existing B+ tree. The
  % following steps are necessary:
  %   - The values of the root node need to be changed. The comma-separated list
  %     is {3, 5} afterwards.
  %   - The calls of \CreateBTreeNode for level 2 can be removed.
  %   - One call of \CreateBTreeNode needs to be added for level 1. Previously,
  %     level 1 one consisted of two nodes, now it consists of three nodes. The
  %     numbering of the nodes has to be correct (1 - 3) and the variable names
  %     are chosen according to the level and the node number, e.g. for node 2 of
  %     level 1, the variable is named \levelOneNodeTwo.
  %   - When generating the tree, all clauses generating level 2 are removed and
  %     a clause to generate a third node on level 1 is added. The content of the
  %     nodes is assigned accordingly.
  %   - Only the first call of \ConnectBTreeNodes has to be kept, the other two
  %     subsequent calls are removed. The kept call needs to be changed because
  %     we now have three instead of two nodes on level 1.
  %   - The \ConnectBTreeLeaves call has to be altered too. The level of the leaf
  %     nodes has changed (now 1, formerly it was 2) and the number of leaves has
  %     changed (now 3 instead of previously 4).
  %   - The tikzpicture options are shortened. The style for level 2 of the tree
  %     is removed (not used anymore). Also the sibling and level distance of
  %     level 1 is changed, both to 8em. Last but not least, the scaling is
  %     reset/removed - the global tikzpicture scaling was reset to 1 and the
  %     BTreeNodeScaled style was removed because node scaling is needed.
